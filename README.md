This project is part of the Data Scientist Nano Degree Program of Udacity. 

These are the questions for which I tried to find answer based on the Boston AirBnB dataset:

1. How does the number of available places influence the average price
2. Is there any seasonal pattern in the prices
3. Which are the most influencing amenity factors of the prices
